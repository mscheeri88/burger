Burger App:

Working:
- My burger app works according to functionality
- I can add new burgers, with names and 'eat me' functionality that will place it with the devoured burgers
- My CSS is lacking in luster, sorry guys
- Maybe I can show a demo to one of you?  Not sure how to show you the working product without it being deployed to heroku :( 


Not Working:
- Heroku....can't get it to deploy, I did the JAWS DB and everything seemed to run find and my build was succesfull but for some reason just says application error on Heroku and no other information.
